## Final Outcome
At the end of this we should be able to:
- Implement supervised learning algorithms for regression and classification tasks
- Understand and apply advanced learning algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees
- Utilize unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and anomaly detection
- Build recommender systems using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches
- Develop reinforcement learning algorithms, as demonstrated by the implementation of Deep Q-Learning for landing the Lunar Lander.
